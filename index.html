                                You&rsquo;ve been taken to jail, probably saw a judge and likely posted bond. If your
                                license was valid when you were arrested, you&rsquo;re driving for business purposes
                                only for 10 days following your arrest. But now the clock is ticking. Action must be
                                taken within 10 days of your arrest to allow you to keep driving.

                            </p>

                                First, I will work to challenge the suspension of your license or help you get a
                                hardship license, if you are eligible. To do this, we must act within 10 days of your
                                arrest. If you miss this 10-day window you won&rsquo;t drive again for at least 30 to 90
                                days. Don&rsquo;t waste a single day, call me now! Once we&rsquo;ve secured your ability
                                to drive, we will review the evidence and attack the criminal case against you.

                                Law enforcement responded to a report of a domestic incident involving you and a family
                                member and you were arrested. You saw a judge and likely were told you can have no
                                contact with the alleged victim, and in many cases, you were prohibited from returning
                                to your own home. You are now living in a hotel or staying with friends with no idea
                                what to do next.

                                Moving quickly is key in these situations. To begin prosecution, the State must file a
                                document called an &ldquo;Information.&rdquo; Call me immediately after your arrest and
                                I will work to have the case against you dismissed before an Information is filed. If a
                                charge must be filed, I will work to make sure it is the lowest level offense possible.
                                I will also file a motion asking the court to allow you to have contact with the alleged
                                victim while the case is pending, provided they desire contact with you. If a charge has
                                been filed, we will then explore your defenses and work quickly to bring about a
                                favorable resolution.

                                You were arrested and accused of possessing narcotics. This could have happened in a
                                variety of ways. You may have been arrested and drugs found on your person, you may have
                                been stopped in a vehicle, or in some cases, a search warrant may have been executed at
                                your home or business. You are now likely facing felony charges and your freedom, your
                                future, and your ability to drive are on the line.

                                I will first look at the circumstances of your arrest and challenge any unlawful
                                searches. I will then reach out to the prosecutor to discuss any legal issues with the
                                search and attempt to negotiate dismissal or reduction of the charge(s). Aggressive
                                action is crucial in drug cases and having a plan of attack makes all the difference.
                                Even if there is no basis for dismissal of the charges, the right approach can shift the
                                case from one where the State seeks punishment to one where rehabilitation becomes the
                                focus, resulting in a favorable resolution that allows your life to go on and your
                                future to remain intact.

                                yet, I will work to prevent them from being filed. If a charge must be filed, I will
                                attempt to persuade the prosecutor to file the lowest allowable offense. I will then
                                work tirelessly to achieve the best result possible as quickly as I can. I will review
                                the evidence, interview witnesses, and leave no stone unturned while crafting an
                                aggressive and comprehensive defense to this serious felony.

                                You&rsquo;ve been accused of taking property that didn&rsquo;t belong to you. The
                                charge(s) you are facing can vary and will depend on the value of the property at issue
                                and your criminal history. If it is alleged the theft was committed with the use or
                                threat of force, you are likely facing a robbery charge, which is an extremely serious
                                felony that can result in a prison sentence.

                                You were previously placed on probation and you are alleged to have violated one or more
                                of the conditions. Violations can be &ldquo;technical,&rdquo; like failing to complete a
                                class, evaluation, or community service, or failing a drug test. Violations resulting
                                from an arrest for a new crime are known as a &ldquo;new law&rdquo; violation.
                                Regardless of the type, all probation violations are serious because they typically
                                result in a warrant being issued and a person sitting in jail for weeks without bond,
                                waiting for their first court date.

                                hearing, I will immediately contact your probation officer to obtain the details of the
                                alleged violation, your history on probation, and their recommendation to resolve the
                                violation. Next, I will speak with the prosecutor to either present your defenses or
                                negotiate a favorable resolution. I will then appear at your hearing to either challenge
                                the alleged violation or have you placed back on probation, if appropriate.

                                You were pulled over and subsequently charged with a driving offense. These offenses can
                                range from driving with a suspended license, to reckless driving, to Florida&rsquo;s
                                newly enacted &ldquo;Super Speeder&rdquo; law, to racing on the highway. The
                                consequences you are facing depend on your circumstances, but in the majority of cases,
                                you will not be able to drive until your situation is rectified.

                                I will first review your driving record and determine how to approach your situation. If
                                you have been charged with racing, reckless driving, or as a super speeder, I will
                                investigate the allegations and formulate any possible defenses. If your license is
                                suspended, I will identify the suspensions and help you clear them, if they can be
                                cleared, so you can reinstate your driver&rsquo;s license. The goal is always to get you
                                driving legally again and keep you from having issues in the future.
