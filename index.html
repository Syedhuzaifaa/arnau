                                You’ve been taken to jail, probably saw a judge and likely posted bond. If your license
                                was valid when you were arrested, your driving or business suspension only lasts for 10
                                days following your arrest. But now the clock is ticking. Action must be taken within 10
                                days of your arrest to allow you to keep driving.
                            </p>

                                I’ll work to challenge the suspension of your license or help you get a hardship
                                license. If you are eligible to do this, we must act within 10 days of your arrest! If
                                you miss this 10-day window, you can’t drive again for at least 30 to 90 days. Don’t
                                wait a single day — call now! Once we’ve secured your ability to drive, we’ll examine
                                the evidence and attack the criminal case against you.

                                contact with the alleged victim, and in many cases, you were released from jail
                                wondering what to do next.

                                Moving quickly is key in these situations. To begin prosecution, the State must file a
                                document called an “Information.” I will immediately after your arrest and will work to
                                have the case against you dismissed before an Information is filed. If a charge must be
                                filed, I will work to make sure it is the lowest level offense possible. I will also
                                file a motion asking the court to allow you to have contact with the alleged victim
                                while the case is pending, provided they agree contact with you. If a charge has been
                                filed, we will then explore your defenses and work quickly to bring about a favorable
                                resolution.

                                You were arrested and accused of possessing narcotics. This could have happened in a
                                variety of ways. You may have been arrested with drugs found on your person, you may
                                have been stopped in a vehicle, or in some cases, a search warrant may have been
                                executed on your home. A conviction for a drug-related felony or even a misdemeanor can
                                affect your freedom, your future, and your ability to drive or earn a living.

                                I will first look at the circumstances of your arrest and challenge any unlawful

                                search and attempt to obtain a dismissal of the charges or a reduction to something
                                less. This step is crucial in drug cases and having the right approach can shift the
                                case from one where the State seeks punishment to one where rehabilitation becomes the
                                focus, resulting in a favorable resolution that allows your life to go on and your

                                with the case. Depending on the charge, a burglary conviction can range from probation
                                all the way to a life felony.

                                <strong> What’s Happening:</strong>
                                You were previously placed on probation and are now alleged to have violated one or more
                                of the conditions. Violations can be “technical,” like failing to complete a class,
                                evaluation, or community service, or failing a drug test. Violations resulting from an
                                arrest for a new crime are known as “new-law” violations. Regardless of the type, all
                                probation violations are serious because they typically result in a warrant being issued
                                and persons sitting in jail for weeks or months waiting for their first court date.
                            </p>

                                If a warrant has not yet been issued or executed, I will immediately file a motion
                                asking the court to schedule a hearing for an alternative resolution. If one has been
                                issued or executed, whether you are in custody or scheduled for an in-custody violation
                                hearing, I will immediately contact your probation officer to obtain the details of the
                                alleged violation. Next, I will speak with the State to present your defenses or
                                negotiate a favorable resolution. I will then appear at your hearing to either challenge
                                the alleged violation or have you placed back on probation, if appropriate.

                                You were pulled over and subsequently charged with a driving offense. These offenses can

                                eluding, or even “Super Speeding” law, to racing on the highway. The consequences can be
                                serious and may include jail time. In many driving offenses cases, there are technical
                                or legal defenses that can help.

                                I will first review your driving record and then match it to the underlying facts of
                                your situation. If you have been charged with racing, suspended license, or careless
                                driving, I will examine whether the citation was lawfully issued and formulate any
                                possible defenses. If your license is suspended, I’ll look for reinstatement options and
                                explore whether they can be cleared so you can resume driving. The goal is always to get
                                you driving legally again and keep you from having issues in the future.

                                We will meet and determine whether your record is eligible to be sealed or expunged. If

                                have the certificate, we’ll petition the court for expungement or sealing. If the plea
                                is needed, I will prepare and file the pleading as needed to get your record sealed.
                                This process can take up to 6 months, so don’t wait to get started.
